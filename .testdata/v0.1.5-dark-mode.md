I'm excited to announce that you can now configure the appearance of your changelog with **Dark Mode** support! Choose between **Dark**, **Light**, or follow the **System Theme** for a look that fits your brand.  

The theme can easily be switched in the changelog settings, or using the `openchangelog.yml` config when self-hosting.
