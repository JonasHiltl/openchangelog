I'm excited to announce that the **open beta** of [Openchangelog](https://openchangelog.com) is now live!

You can now deploy and customize your changelog on our global platform. With our seamless GitHub Integration you can directly sync your product updates from GitHub.

Please try out our features, and provide feedback to help us shape the future of Openchangelog together.
